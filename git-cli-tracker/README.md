# Git CLI Tracker
A Bash script that detects file changes and auto-commits them.
## Usage
```bash
./tracker.sh 60 auto
# Every 60 s, commit & push any change with message "auto: snapshot <timestamp>"

---

## Next mini-targets (≈ 30 min)

| Task | Est. time |
|------|-----------|
| Make `tracker.sh` executable & verify push | 10 min |
| Add README usage section, commit & push | 5 min |
| Create a **Hello-World route** in `flask-portfolio/app.py` | 10 min |
| Commit & push again (your tracker can even do it!) | 5 min |

After that we’ll:

1. Flesh out the Flask portfolio app.  
2. Deploy it to an EC2 instance via CLI (tomorrow).  
3. Begin Docker fundamentals.

Ping me once `tracker.sh` is running or if you hit any bumps, and we’ll keep rolling! we will continue later
