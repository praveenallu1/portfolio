# Flask Portfolio
Personal cloud-hosted portfolio site (deployed later to AWS EC2).
## Quick Start

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

python app.py




Then commit/push again.

### What I  just accomplished

| Milestone | Skill unlocked |
|-----------|----------------|
| Virtual env setup | Isolated Python environments |
| Flask routing | Basics of Python web frameworks |
| Health-check endpoint | Good practice for future load balancers/K8s probes |
| requirements.txt | Reproducible deployments |
| Git workflow | Stage → commit → push |

### Next options

1. **Will add a second route** (e.g., `/about`) that returns JSON with your bio.  
2. **Deploy this Flask app to an AWS EC2 instance** using CLI + SSH (tomorrow’s goal).  
3. **Return to Bash** and enhance `tracker.sh` (e.g., ignore certain folders).
